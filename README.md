## Features

- **Easy installation:** native DLSS games, or compatible non-DLSS games through DLSS5-Feeder.
- **Your library:** Steam, Epic, GOG, modern Xbox Game Pass folders, and manually added games/emulators. On Linux: Steam Play, Heroic and Lutris.
- **Search and filters:** combine title, graphics API, DLSS status/version and add-ons; click counters to filter.
- **Flexible layout:** group by store or show everything in one list, with game artwork and light/dark themes.
- **Controlled scanning:** full-drive scanning is **off by default**. Added folders still scan normally; enable all-drive discovery or remove scan folders in Settings.
- **Right-click shortcuts:** open/copy folder, rescan, change cover, restore originals or hide a game.
- **Backups and History:** restore original files, keep installation records, and copy History/activity/install logs.
- **Custom add-ons:** the Add-ons page remains available alongside the integrated installation routes.

## New in 2.2.0

- **⭐ Optional [OptiScaler DLSS-NR](https://github.com/Dagherbou/OptiScaler_DLSSNR/releases):** choose it in the game page instead of ReShade. Apply the change with the game closed; switch back when wanted. Settings are kept separately.
- **SWTOR / DX9:** correct Feeder selection instead of the native-only route; adds 32-bit DX8 installation.
- **Feeder repairs:** matching 0.12.0 components, corrected shader/preset settings, and missing Visual C++ runtime checks.
- **Better detection:** small/nested executables and Cyberpunk 2077 / Phantom Liberty library entries.
- **Safer installs/restores:** preserve native Streamline/FG files, protect backups during repeat installs and backend switches, and restore even when the executable is missing.
- **History and translations:** fixes missing installation history; search, filters and installation warnings now cover all 38 languages.

## Compatibility

| Category | Support |
| --- | --- |
| **System** | Windows 10/11 x64; compatible 32-bit and 64-bit games. Linux: Windows games run through Proton or Wine — see [Linux](#linux) |
| **ReShade / Feeder GPUs** | RTX 20 / 30 / 40 / 50; older-series support is reported by the bundled modified runtime's author |
| **OptiScaler GPUs** | RTX 50 only, NVIDIA driver **616.56+**, 64-bit games with native DLSS enabled |
| **DirectX 12** | Native DLSS, Feeder, or eligible OptiScaler games |
| **DirectX 11** | Feeder for 32/64-bit games; eligible OptiScaler games |
| **DirectX 9 / 8** | DX9: 32/64-bit; DX8: 32-bit, through dgVoodoo2 → DX11 → Feeder |
| **Vulkan / OpenGL** | ReShade/Feeder; eligible Vulkan games can also use OptiScaler. On Linux, Vulkan is OptiScaler only |
| **DirectX 10** | Not directly supported by Feeder; choose DX11 when available |

OptiScaler's DX11/Vulkan path uses a DX12 bridge with FSR output by default.
For Vulkan backend changes, **restore originals first**. OptiScaler is not the emulator/non-DLSS route.

## Linux

Windows games launched through Proton or Wine. A Linux-native build of a game cannot load the
Windows DLSS payload and is skipped.

**What is found**

| Launcher | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **Steam Play** | Native, and the Flatpak install. The game's own `compatdata` prefix is used |
| **Heroic** | Epic, GOG, Amazon and sideloaded games; native and Flatpak |
| **Lutris** | Wine games; native and Flatpak |

Full-drive scanning finds nothing here — it enumerates Windows drive letters. Add folders by hand
in Settings instead.

**What works**

- Swapping the DLSS runtime on a game that already has DLSS, and the OptiScaler route including
  its Vulkan path.
- ReShade Setup, run inside the prefix the game already uses — the Steam Play prefix, or the Wine
  prefix Heroic or Lutris made for it. Installs that never reach the setup do not need a prefix at
  all.
- The "close the game first" check, which reads `/proc` rather than asking PowerShell.

**What does not**

- **The Feeder route**, which is refused outright. It patched launchers rather than games and left
  Proton titles unable to start — found by [Febsho](https://github.com/Febsho/DLSS5-Swapper-Linux),
  who shipped Linux builds and watched them break. Vulkan never reached it here anyway: the Feeder
  registers ReShade as a Windows implicit layer, and Wine hands layer enumeration to the host
  Vulkan loader, which loads `.so` layers and never a Windows ReShade DLL. Use Native DLSS, or
  OptiScaler for Vulkan.
- **A game that already has a non-add-on ReShade.** The existing proxy may belong to another mod or
  loader, and replacing it crashed otherwise healthy games. Same source.
- **Lutris games on a Proton runner**, which is launched through umu, and **Heroic CrossOver
  bottles**. Both are found and can still take a plain DLL swap; only the ReShade Setup step is
  unavailable.
- **Emulators**, in practice. The Linux builds people actually run are native, and the Windows
  builds that would work under Wine go through the Feeder, which is refused above.
- The OptiScaler GPU gate compares the NVIDIA driver against a Windows version number, and the
  Linux driver does not use the same numbering. That threshold has not been checked against the
  real DLSS 5 requirement.

**Running it**

There are no Linux binaries. Run from source (tested on Node 24):

```bash
npm install && npm start
```

Installing anything also needs the `payload/` folder — the DLSS 5 runtime, ReShade Setup and the
Feeder components. It is not in the repository and has to be supplied yourself; without it the app
starts and lists your games but cannot install. `npm run build:linux` needs it too. See
`scripts/collect-payload.js`.

> None of the Linux path has been tested against a real installed game. File locations and the
> environment each launcher uses were read out of Heroic's and Lutris' own shipped code, and the
> behaviour is covered by the test suite, but treat it as untried and keep your backups.

## Emulators

Select the emulator folder and its active renderer, then use **ReShade/Feeder**.

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="3">Emulators</th></tr>
  <tr><td>DuckStation</td><td>PCSX2</td><td>RPCS3</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Dolphin</td><td>PPSSPP</td><td>Xenia</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Cemu</td><td>Ryujinx</td><td>yuzu / suyu / Eden / Citron / Sudachi</td></tr>
  <tr><td>shadPS4</td><td>Azahar / Citra / Lime3DS</td><td>melonDS</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Flycast</td><td>xemu</td><td>Vita3K</td></tr>
  <tr><td>RetroArch</td><td>mGBA</td><td>Snes9x</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Play!</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
</table>

Compatibility varies by renderer and game. Xenia HUD correction remains experimental.

## Before installing

- **Anti-cheat:** red warning and optional confirmation, not a blanket block. Injection can cause crashes or account bans; the app never bypasses anti-cheat.
- **Requirements:** Feeder needs Visual C++ runtimes (x64, plus x86 for 32-bit games). Some components download on first use.
- **Compatibility is not guaranteed.** Keep backups; existing mods may conflict. Not every reported game crash is fixed.
- **Linux/Proton:** source only and untested against a real game — see [Linux](#linux).
